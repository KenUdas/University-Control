## PROJECT CONTEXT

### Introduction to Current Work

I have started a digital restoration effort on James McKeen Cattell’s University Control, published in 1914. Although a variety of paper versions are available, there is not clean and well-formatted electronic version. University Control can be downloaded in multiple formats on the Internet Archive, but the renderings are riddled with formatting inconsistences, misspellings, and poorly rendered markup, which is indicative of automated digitalization and conversion. Although it is with great appreciation that I could start with a good base document, I felt that the quality of the renderings reduced readability, particularly for those requiring assistive technologies. During the restoration I have:

* Recoding all text using well structured HTML5 and CCS3.
* Included page numbers.
* Included sematic inflection in accordance with ePUB 3 International Digital Publishing Standards for universal design.
* Corrected formatting, errant marks, missing words, and typographical errors.
* Created a well-structured table of contents and page list for easy navigation.
* Linked references to and from end notes.
* Linked the glossary to text.

### Invitation for Participation
I am an armature hobbyist with the standards used for ePub production. I am also a novice with GitHub. I have only published the ePub files, but when there is interest shown by a volunteer to access and modify files, I will post them in this repository as well. I would appreciate any help to improve the quality of the ePub.

I will continue to make improvements and will eventually publish a Task Backlog for this project with known improvement needs. A list of files with descriptions is also forthcoming.

### Accessing and Editing Files
It you prefer downloading the ePUB files, you can open and edit them using a number of editors. I have used [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to edit the source files and compile the ePub document. Calibre is an open source product, with a constant stream of improvements and updates. I have found using it excellent and recommend it for anybody interested in viewing and editing the source files.


## FUTURE WORK
My intent is to annotate the document and include additional content for context. I will create a separate repository for an edited and annotated version of *University Control*. I will also create a separate repository (or add to an existing repository) that includes well formatted ePub versions of the resources referenced in *University Control*. It is my hope that the annotated version of the text along with the original source materials can be used by teachers and scholars of university governance, the history of educational administration, the progressive era in the United States, and related areas of study. I would very much like to enhance the visual reading experience as well, and would appreciate recommendations from anybody with any experience.

Additional sections for an annotated version of *University Control* may include:
* Biographical information about Cattell (timeline)
* Brief biographical information on the Professors Protest Literature authors
* Literature review of Professors Protest Literature
* Summary and analysis of Cattell’s proposal on University Control
* Summary and analysis of responses to the University Control (298 letters)
* Additional protest literature in the public domain
* Impact of this movement (New School of Social Research, Beard and Robinsons’ resignations and writing, AAUP…)
* Overview of the structure of the University sector then and now (number of universities, size od faculties, number of students, etc.)
